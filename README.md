# Coding-Portfolio
A portfolio of programs I made that I am proud of.
All of these programs will be made in Java or C.

Here is a list and description of the projects I have finished.

Each folder will contain a runnable file of the project and the source code for said file.

MyGameOfLife(Java) - a program that simulates and run conways game of life it make a gui that you can click to place cells down and a start and stop button to stop the simulation.

TetrisGame(Java) - a program made with a partner that is a recreation of the game tetris in java. The jar works alone but if you want sound the wav file needs to be in the same folder when launched. Control can be found in the read me. Me and my partner worked on it simultaneously so there is no one part that was made by us.

Queens Problem Solver GUI(Java) - a program made in my Adv Computer Science AB class in high school as extra credit. It places queens in a way that they dont attack each other and it places the amount that you type in. There seems to be a bug that messes with the gui aspect of the scaleing but this might be just my computer because I remember it working on my laptop where I made the program.

I will be adding more as time goes on and as I finish more projects
