# Coding-Portfolio
A portfolio of programs I made that I am proud of.
All of these programs will be made in Java or C#.

Here is a list and description of the projects I have finished.

Each folder will contain a runnable file of the project and the source code for said file.

MyGameOfLife(Java) - a program that simulates and run conways game of life it make a gui that you can click to place cells down and a start and stop button to stop the simulation.

TetrisGame(Java) - a program made with a partner that is a recreation of the game tetris in java. The jar works alone but if you want sound the wav file needs to be in the same folder when launched. Control can be found in the read me.

I will be adding more as time goes on and as I finish more projects
